<h3>Directions</h3>
<!--Directions for cooking the food-->

<ol>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with foil, <br />
        and arrange the bacon in an even layer on top. <br />
        Place in a cold oven, and set the oven to 420°F(220°C). <br />
        Roast the bacon for 20 minutes or until nicley browned, <br />
        crispy, and cooked through.  Remove the bacon, and let it <br />
        drain and cool  on the paper towels.<br />
       </li>
       
       <br />
       <li>In a large nonstick skillet,  <br />
        heat the butter over medium heat.<br />
        In a large bowl, whisk the eggs <br />
        until thoroughly combined.<br />
        Once the butter is melted and bubbling, <br />
        add the eggs to the skillet.<br />
    </li>
    <br />
    
    
    
    <li>Constantly stir the eggs, scrambling <br />
        together the cooked egg with the uncooked egg.<br />
        Just before the eggs are fully cooked, <br />
        remove the skillet from the heat.<br />
        Countinue stirring until the eggs are <br />
        just barley set together and cooked but not rubbery.<br />
        Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br />
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>If the tortillas arent already charred <br />
        from making them first from scrath,<br />
        heat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. <br />
        Once hot, working 1 at a time,<br />
        very lightly cchar the tortillas on both sides. <br />
        If the pan is hot enough, this should <br />
        take 20 to 25 seconds per side. Turn the <br />
        heat down if theyre charring too quickly. If the tortillas<br />
        are already charred, make sure theyre hot a pliable.<br />
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>To assemble the tacos, In the cnter of each <br />
        charred tortilla, add a scoop of the scrambled eggs, <br />
        followed by a strip of cooked bacon, crumbled <br />
        cotiha, cilantro leaves, and jalapeno salsa <br />
